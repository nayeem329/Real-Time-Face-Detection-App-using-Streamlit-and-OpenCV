    # Explanation:
    # Pre-trained Model: The term "pre-trained model" refers to a machine learning model that has already been trained on a large dataset for a specific task. In this case, the pre-trained model is for face detection.
    # Haar Cascade Classifier: Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach that is used to identify objects in images or video streams. It works by training a cascade function on positive and negative images. The cascade function contains multiple stages, each of which contains a set of classifiers.
    # haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: This XML file contains the trained data for the Haar cascade classifier specifically designed for frontal face detection. It consists of a set of features and weights that the classifier uses to identify whether a particular region of an image contains a face or not.
    # cv2.CascadeClassifier: This is a function provided by the OpenCV library that loads a cascade classifier from a file. It takes the path to the XML file as input and returns a cascade classifier object.
    # cv2.data.haarcascades: This is a predefined path in OpenCV where the pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers are stored. It contains XML files for various objects such as faces, eyes, and smiles.
